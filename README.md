# CiscoNetworking

For my Computer Networking class at university, I developed a Cisco network project where I designed and configured a robust network topology featuring multiple subnets. <br>
I segmented the network based on the unique needs of each subnet, optimizing IP address allocation, routing configurations, and overall network connectivity.

During the development of this project, I met several technical requirements, including:

* Designing the network architecture and ensuring the correct physical connections between devices.
* Subnetting the provided IP range to ensure efficient IP address allocation across different subnets.
* Assigning static IP addresses to essential network devices and configuring DHCP for dynamic IP address assignment for each subnet.
* Properly configuring default gateways on devices and verifying inter-network connectivity through ping tests.
* Configuring both static and dynamic routing protocols, with RIP employed for dynamic routing.
* Setting up DNS and web servers and ensuring their accessibility from any device within the network.
* Employing minimal IP address classes for inter-router connections, optimizing address space usage.
* Implementing NAT to map private addresses to public addresses for outgoing traffic.

This project simulates a corporate network environment, providing a platform for testing routing configurations and establishing essential network services.
